1. I read online articles/watched youtube videos on the subject and wrote a summary, see "Summary of Initial Research" document
2. I started a list of references in the README to populate over the course of the project.
3. I downloaded the Data Set (1999 version) and Data Set Description from  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
4. I'm a visual person so I also downloaded and saved images of the three types of iris...however they are
    still very difficult to distinguish visually!
5. I read about pandas - the open source python library that provides high level data analysis tools. 
    It runs on top of numPy - a foundational data structure for many python libraries.   
6. I used python code to familiarise myself with pandas and how it can be used to investigate the iris dataset.  
7.I learned that pandas is an efficient tool that displays/arranges the data in a meaningful way usually with just one command.
8.The df.dtypes command returned the numerical data as being "float64" data type, this is how
pandas refers to floating point numbers.  The species of flower was classified as an object.
sepal length in cm    float64
species                object
