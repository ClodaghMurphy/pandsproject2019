## 1. Introduction
This repository contains pandsproject2019.<br>  
Using Fisher's Iris data set, I will explain the basic principles of investigating a data set <br>
and how Python can be used in the endeavour.<br>
## 2. A summary of the data set - what is it? why is it important?


    
   
  

According to wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant)
    >'Iris is a genus of 260–300 species of flowering plants with "showy" flowers.' 
The flower takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris.
Three Iris varieties are used in the Iris flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The 
use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.  
Discriminant analysis aims to classify the flower species from the four measurements provided in the dataset.



CONTENTS OF THE IRIS DATASET
The Data Set consists of information about 50 flowers from Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor
(three species of Iris).
Measurements of 
1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
were recorded along with the species.
Therefore, the dataset consists of 150 rows and 4 columns.

This is a sample line from the Irish data set in csv format:<br>
*5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa*<br>
It indicates a sepal length of 5.1cm, sepal width of 3.5cm, petal length of 1.4cm and petal width of 0.2cm<br>
These measurements belong to an Iris-setosa flower collected as part of the experiment in 1936.<br>

 The Iris Data Set is important because<br>
   (a) it is considered to be one of the most versatile datasets available in pattern recognition literature. <br>
   (b) it is an ideal sample to use when learning about data analysis due to it's compact nature (150 lines) and high accuracy, <br>
   (c) Ronald Fisher's original 1936 paper proves that once measurements are available it is possible predict the variety of Iris with a high degree of accuracy- an important tenet of data analysis<br>

## 4. How to run the python code used to investigate the data set
    

        
On github.com choose the "Clone or download" button to copy the code onto your machine.<br>
For further information on how github works video guides are available here https://www.youtube.com/githubguides<br>
The latest version of Python can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/<br>
If you don't have a preferred CLI, the IDLE graphical user interface will be automatically installed when you download from this site and can be used for running python programs.<br>
