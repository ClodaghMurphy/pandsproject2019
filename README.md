    Introduction<br>
This repository contains pandsproject2019.<br>  
Using Fisher's Iris data set, I will explain the basic principles of investigating a data set <br>
and how Python can be used in the endeavour.<br>
    <li>2. A summary of the data set - what is it and why is it important?</li> 
    According to wikipedia, Iris is a genus of 260â€“300 species of flowering plants with "showy" flowers.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant)
    The Iris Data Set is considered to be the most versatile one available in
pattern recognition literature. <br>
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/<br>

Because of it's compact nature and high accuracy, the data set is an ideal sample
to use when learning about data analysis.

It takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris.
Three Iris varieties are used in the Iris flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The 
use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.  

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), normal discriminant analysis (NDA), or discriminant function analysis 
is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and 
machine learning to find linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.<br>

CONTENTS OF THE IRIS DATASET
The Data Set consists of information about 50 flowers from Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor
(three species of Iris).
Measurements of 
1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
were recorded along with the species.
Therefore, the dataset consists of 150 rows and 4 columns.

This is a sample line from the Irish data set in csv format:
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
It indicates a sepal length of 5.1cm, sepal width of 3.5cm, petal length of 1.4cm and petal width of 0.2cm
These measurements belong to an Iris-setosa flower collected as part of the experiment in 1936.
Ronald Fisher's 1936 paper proves that once the measurements listed above are available
it is possible predict the variety of Irish with a high degree of accuracy.
