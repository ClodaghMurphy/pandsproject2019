#The README should contain: 
##1. A summary of the data set 
##2. Your investigations into it
##3. Clearly document how to run the python code you used to investigate the data set
##4. What that python code does
##5. It should list all the references used in completing the project

<ul>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three
        <ul>
 


###3. Clearly document how to run the python code you used to investigate the data set
On github.com choose the "Clone or download" button to copy the code onto your machine.
For further information on how github works video guides are available here https://www.youtube.com/githubguides
The latest version of Python can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/
If you don't have a preferred CLI, the IDLE graphical user interface will be automatically installed when you download from this site and can be used for running python programs.

###4. What the python code in this project does

    Analysis 2 | Reads a text file into a dataframe
    Analysis 3 | Top and tail the list
    Analysis 4 | Print the data types in the data set
    Analysis 5 | Print index details
    Analysis 6 | Print column titles
    Analysis 7 | Print values contained in the table/dataframe
    Analysis 8 | Print statistical summary of the data
    Analysis 9 | Sort the records by a particular column or columns
